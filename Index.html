            <h1>Hi, I'm Ishita Singh! 👋</h1>
            <p> Welcome to my page! Iam currently a Sophomore at Emerald High School in Dublin, CA–To learn more about me read below: 

Some of my goals include becoming an Electrical Engineer or a Software Engineer.I want to focus on areas where innovation can lead to real improvements. This means I will study subjects like power management and machine learning algorithms. I plan to achieve this by earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science from a competitive school. While in college, I will participate in research projects and co-op programs to gain practical experience and build my technical skills. My decision to pursue this field comes from being inspired by my parents, both software engineers. Watching them work on meaningful projects motivates me to achieve similar goals.

Additionally my Resume shows my strong skills in Software Development and Leadership. As part of the software team in and in Robotics FTC competitor team, I learned how to write and debug code under pressure. I currently conduct research at a Silicon Valley lab and plan to present my work at the CCIR Cambridge Symposium this summer. My ability to discuss complex issues is demonstrated by my success as a quarter finalist in the UC Berkeley Cal Invitational for Varsity Speech and Debate. Additionally, I serve as Outreach Director for the STEM organization Girls Power the World, where I helped organize seminars that reached over 9.3k people.

These experiences have helped me develop important professional qualities like perseverance and reliability. My ongoing technical work and research highlight my ability to think critically and solve problems. For example, as a Brand Ambassador for MySocialEdge, a non-profit organization, I published over twelve articles and connected with hundreds of people. This improved my communication and outreach skills, allowing me to explain complex concepts clearly. Also, my role as a Peer Mentor during my computer science internship at Building-U and my commitment to tutoring a student show my dedication and reliability in meeting responsibilities. Thank you for reviewing my qualifications and goals. I encourage you to explore the rest of my site to learn more about my background and professional interests.

In general, my background in technical research, leadership, and community outreach has taught me a lot and strengthened my desire to succeed in engineering. The consistent application of my skills in computer science is evident in my accomplishments. Thank you for reading this, and I invite you to explore the rest of my site to learn more about me.
