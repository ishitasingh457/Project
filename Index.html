            <h1>Hi, I'm Ishita Singh! 👋</h1>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Welcome to my page! I am currently a Sophomore at Emerald High School in Dublin, CA. Some of my goals include becoming an Electrical Engineer or a Software Engineer where innovation leads to real improvements. I plan to achieve this by earning a Bachelor of Science from a competitive school, inspired by my parents who are both software engineers.</p>
                
                <p>My background includes writing and debugging code under pressure for an FTC Robotics team, conducting research at the Mountain View lab, and serving as Outreach Director for Girls Power the World. I'm also a quarter-finalist in Varsity Speech and Debate, which helps me communicate complex ideas clearly.</p>

                    <h3>Act Fast Project</h3>
                    <p>This App is called ACT fast and designed to educate people about emergencies that may happen. We picked 4 Emergencies: Flooding, Earthquake,Fire,Intruder. Users will first face the introduction screen and then the Option screen where they can pick what disaster they want to learn about, depending on what they pick-they will each be taken to a different screen where there are key details and important facts about what to do in a situation of an emergency. Once they are done reading up on it, they will click on a button that takes them to a quiz where they can test their knowledge!This app was  developed using MIT App Inventor, using a block-based coding system to manage the app's logic. To make the home screen dynamic, I integrated an API that fetches and displays live weather data, like temperature and humidity based on the user's location. I used Layout components to organize the different emergency categories, such as Fire, Earthquake, Flood, and Lockdown, ensuring each had its own dedicated information page. For the interactive quizzes, I programmed Conditional Logic (If/Then blocks) to check if the user selected the correct checkboxes; this allows the app to trigger "Success" messages when answers are right or "Error" alerts if a question is missed or answered incorrectly. Finally, I used Notifier components to give users instant feedback, making the learning process feel like a real.</p>

                    <h3>Interview questionnaire app </h3>
                    <p>This Questionnaire app Is an interview based design. It asks questions relating to the school community such as “How can we improve our school culture and sense of community?”.The user will either type or record their answer by clicking on a button and it will automatically get typed into the textbox for the app. Additionally the user will also be asked to say a date, once they click on the date button, another calendar type page will appear where they can select the date. For the developer of the app, they can retrieve the info database, clear the database as well as save to csv.  I used nested If/Then/Else blocks to check multiple conditions at once; for example, one block checks if all checkboxes are empty using "or" logic, and if they are, it triggers a Notifier to tell the user to answer all questions. For the CSV export function that uses a For Each loop to grab all the tags from the database and format them into a text file so the data can be opened in a spreadsheet later..</p>
